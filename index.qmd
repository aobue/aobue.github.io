I'm a graduate student studying data science and international development at Stanford. Previously I earned my MBA from the University of Chicago as an Edwardson Civic Scholar. I used to work in homeless services and more recently was a consulting data scientist in the World Bank Group's Department for Outcomes. I'm interested in using technology and statistics to make humanitarian and development assistance more effective.
