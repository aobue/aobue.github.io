Dear Lija McHugh Farnham, 

After six years in direct service --- from working as a reentry specialist to managing rapid rehousing and eviction prevention programs in San Francisco --- I've seen firsthand how consulting without frontline credibility fails. A nonprofit manager recently told me BCG's strategic plan was rejected by staff who couldn't trust consultants with no implementation experience.

This is exactly why I'm pursuing a career in consulting --- to be the consultant I wished my organizations had. Consulting multiplies my impact: instead of improving one program, I can help dozens of organizations serve thousands. My World Bank and Stanford training in data science and policy, combined with my frontline experience and MBA from the University of Chicago, uniquely positions me to close the gap between strategy and implementation.

The Bridgespan Group aligns with my values because you understand the importance of building bridges between philanthropy, nonprofits, and government to achieve sustainable impact at scale. Your approach of combining analytical depth with genuine collaboration, helping organizations develop internal capacity rather than just delivering recommendations, matches my belief that lasting change comes from empowering clients with both insights and implementation tools.

I am eager to join the Bridgespan Group and help social sector organizations achieve their missions.

\vspace{11pt}
Kind regards,

\vspace{5pt}
Alex Bue
